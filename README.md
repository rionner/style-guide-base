#Why Does This Exist?
In my time as a Front End Dev I've embraced the philosophy of component-based design, construction, and styling. In doing so I figured I'd start a simple group of base component styles which could be built upon and customized as needed for new projects. This repository/app is intended as a starting point for project styles.

Note: There is no CSS autoprefixer included in the app build process, and only a few manually added cross-browser declarations are included in the source. 

#Get it Running:
*npm install
*npm update
*gulp
*node app
